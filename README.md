Make teaching and revision easier
=============

Community driven timeline controlled multimedia animation editor for teachers.

The tool will allow teachers to be able to create and share timelined animations for the purposes of bettering the young minds sat bored in front of them.

The vision?
I cannot remember dates. I am a spatial person, and so I can remember movements and patterns. Sometimes I fell asleep in lectures, so informal learning benefited me.

When I see and interact with a sequence of events, like in an old video game, I can remember exactly which bad guy comes out of which door when.

This project is about mashing up animation techniques, svg and browser graphics capabilities, open source/media commons materials and freely available video. I want to create a something that is standalone and easy to integrate into any educational system, easy to use for the end user, which is the teacher and the student.

Teachers spend a lot of time creating resources. Some teachers would feel very good about allowing others to learn from these resources. I want to try to help them make that happen so that children with shit teachers can go online and have a chance to learn something in an interesting way.

I don't have a clear plan, and neither do I want one. I have nothing even close to finished, but there may be something in here you can use for your own projects. Great.

The most important thing to me is that this is my first real effort to try and give something back, and I have given up my freelance work to do it, so don't expect this project to dwindle and die.
